No-Loss Prize Savings Game

gamified savings protocol

People want to save money and earn returns, but traditional savings offer tiny, boring yields. Lotteries are exciting, but you almost always lose your money. This app solves both proeblems.

X people in, 1 gets their money + the yield, losers get their money back.



FRONTEND: Use of onflow/FCL module if needed in app





Make agent interact with uniswap contracts... etc

🔮 VRF Integration Details:
   The Flow VRF Strategy uses the Cadence Arch contract at:
   0x0000000000000000000000010000000000000001
   This provides secure, on-chain randomness.

🎯 Next Steps:
   1. Use the MockUSDC contract to mint test tokens to your wallet.
      e.g., call 'mint("0xa341b0F69359482862Ed4422c6057cd59560D9E4", "1000000000")' // 1000 USDC
   2. Approve the Vault to spend your USDC.
   3. Deposit your USDC into the Vault contract.
   4. As the agent, call 'depositToStrategy' on the Vault to move funds to the lottery.
   5. Call 'harvest' on the Vault to trigger the lottery and award a winner!
